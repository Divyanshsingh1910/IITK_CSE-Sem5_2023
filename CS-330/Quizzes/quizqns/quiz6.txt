Consider a 3-level paging system for forty-seven bit (47-bit) virtual 
address (as shown above) where the page size (and page frame size) 
is sixteen kilobytes (16 KB). Assume that the OS uses a separate address 
space for itself. Answer the following questions,

(i) What is the maximum amount of physical memory required to maintain the page table for a single process?
(ii) How much virtual address is covered by a single page table entry in 
     Level-2?
(iii) What is the range of the virtual address translated using the fifth      entry (entries counted from one) of the Level-1 page table?
(iv) If a page table entry requires five bits for access flags and four bits are reserved what is the maximum physical memory supported by this system?
(v) If a process has allocated 1GB memory using a single mmap() system call, what is the minimum and maximum memory usage to maintain the page table for the allocated memory?
