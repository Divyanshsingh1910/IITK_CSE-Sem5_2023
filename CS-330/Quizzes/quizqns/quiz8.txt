Q1. Consider an indexed file allocation similar to the Ext2 file system. The file block index structures contained in the inode are as follows: eight direct block addresses, four single-indirect block addresses, and two double-indirect block addresses. The file system block size is 4KB and block address is 32-bits.

(i)  What is the maximum disk size supported by this file system?
(ii) What is the maximum file size supported by this file system?
(iii) If a process reads a block at file offset 512MB of a 2GB file how many disk blocks will be read in total?
(iv) If a process requests to read a single block from a file of size 5GB at a random file offset (4KB aligned), calculate the minimum and maximum size of disk read required to serve the request? 

For (iii) and (iv), assume that only the disk inode corresponding to the file is present (cached) in memory.
