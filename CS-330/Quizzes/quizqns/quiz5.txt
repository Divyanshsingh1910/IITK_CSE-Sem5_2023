Q1. Select the correct answer(s) for the following questions. (2 x 3)
(i) The CR3 register points to the base (level-1) of the page table. Which of the following statement(s) is are true?
    A) At the time of process context switch, CR3 register is updated    
    B) At the time of user-to-OS context switch, CR3 register is updated     
    C) At the time of user-to-OS context switch, CR3 register is updated only if OS uses a separate address space for itself.      
    D) At the time of OS-to-user context switch, CR3 register is updated     
    E) At the time of OS-to-user context switch, CR3 register is updated only if OS uses a separate address space for itself.      
(ii) A process P executes mmap() system call successfully to allocate
     1GB virtual memory. During mmap() system call handling, the OS 
 A) must have manipulated the address space state (in PCB) of the process
 B) must have manipulated the page table entries of the process
 C) may not have changed the page table of the process in any manner
 D) may not have changed the address space state (in PCB) of the process  
 E) may not have performed any physical memory allocation  

Q2. True or False with justification. No marks without proper justification. (2 x 2)
(i) When using translation at address space granularity, memory allocation system calls such 
    as brk() and mmap() are not required to be supported by the OS. 
(ii) Two processes in a single CPU system can not use overlapping physical memory addresses while using segmentation.
