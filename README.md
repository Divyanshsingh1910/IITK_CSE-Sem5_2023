Hi ðŸ‘‹, few folks from the current ongoind batch were approaching for some missing files so... <br>
- **_Note1_**: If you find something incorrect or need some assgn/exam/resource paper which are currently in this repo then feel free to create an issue on this repo and I will try to fetch/correct that doc to the best I can.

- **_Note2_**: Please feel free to contribute the resources of your current ongoing sem if you wish -- it will be of great help for your junior batches.

- **Next semester**:
    - [CSE Sem-6 2023-24](https://github.com/Divyanshsingh1910/IITK_CSE-Sem6_2024)
    - [CSE Sem-7 2024-25 (ongoing)](https://github.com/Divyanshsingh1910/IITK-sem-7-2024)
- _Disclaimer_: This was the last semester which I documented consistently. Sem-6 was really hard because of compiler+linux(+ 10 other reasons) and the repo is a mess. Although, I will try to improve it when I am free.
sem-7 is hard i guess :/
